					<h1> <a id="pantryText" href="https://www.ncf.edu/campus-life/health-safety-and-wellness-mind-body-and-spirit/food-pantry/"> New College Food Pantry</a></h1>
					<br>

					<p>In January 2018, New College of Florida opened the New College Food Pantry (NCFP). The Food Pantry is in partnership with the Peace Education and Action Center, the Food Bank of Manatee and All Faiths Food Bank.  The mission of the NCFP is to support student success by addressing the existence of short-term food insecurity.  Through collaboration across various departments at New College of Florida, student-led research, data collection, and support from campus and local community members, this critical resource provides emergency and supplemental food items of high nutritional value that contribute to the community’s need for access to hunger relief services.</p>

					<h1>Coffee on Campus</h1>
					<br>
					<p>Who doesn't like hot or cold coffee? There is nothing in the world that is better than coffee as morning fuel. The aroma that calls you from a million miles away. The bitterness sends through your soul, filling you up; giving you the warmth that you so desperately crave. And the darkness, the blackness that reminds me all too much of my life. You can find hot/cold coffee on campus at different places:</p>
