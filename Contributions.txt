Metz Redesign Feedback:
3) The social media buttons should have their own icon and color for visibility
4) Does the nutrition info need to be its own page? can it be a pop-up instead?
5) Rethink the Menu page especially consider how this will end up when you build it for the next assignment.
Overall this is a good design. Just remember to keep it simple, with less information and less cluttered.
